Lidar: /PCL
Radar: /Radar
Gps:/Gps
Imu: /Imu


NOTE:
This dataset was recorded with a preliminary setup. The lidar and cameras are synchronized but are missing timestamp information, thus making synchronization with radar and gps/imu difficult.
The radar and gps/imu data in this dataset is not synchronized with the lidar and cameras as a result, and there is no timestamp information in the rectified folder.
